## Features

- Data collection from a publicly available financial dataset.
- Feature engineering to create relevant indicators and metrics.
- Model training using Scikit-Learn.
- Evaluation of model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Visualization of results and predictions.

## Dataset Source

The data used for this project is sourced from the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) API. This API provides historical stock price and trading volume data for a wide range of publicly traded companies. To access the data:

1. Visit the Yahoo Finance website.
2. Search for the stock symbol of the company you're interested in (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.).
3. Navigate to the "Historical Data" section.
4. Select the desired date range and frequency (daily, weekly, etc.).
5. Click "Download Data."

You can also use Python libraries like yfinance to programmatically retrieve data from Yahoo Finance.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for running evaluation notebooks)

You can install Python dependencies using pip:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone [https://github.com/12-arun05/IBM-Phase1.git]
cd stock-price-prediction


2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

3. Follow the dataset source instructions mentioned in the "Dataset Source" section to obtain the historical stock price data.

4. [If there are any additional installation steps, specify them here.]

## Usage

1. Download historical stock price data using the dataset source instructions.
2. Preprocess the data by cleaning and engineering relevant features.
3. Train the model using the provided Jupyter Notebook [train.ipynb].
4. Make predictions using the trained model with the Jupyter Notebook [predict.ipynb].

## Data
This Dataset used  for this project is otianed from [kaggle]:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/microsoft-lifetime-stocks-dataset and is called "Stock Prices" 

The dataset used in this project includes historical stock price data, trading volumes, and other relevant financial metrics for publicly traded companies. It's used for training and evaluating the predictive model. You can access the data from the Yahoo Finance API, as described in the "Dataset Source" section.

## Model Training

The model is trained using Scikit-Learn, which offers a straightforward implementation for predictive modeling. You can find the training code in the [train.ipynb] Jupyter Notebook. Customize the model and hyperparameters to suit your specific use case.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which are standard metrics for regression problems. The evaluation results can be found in the [evaluation.ipynb] Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

The project's results include predictive stock price values based on the trained model. You can visualize these predictions and explore the model's performance in the [evaluation.ipynb] notebook.
